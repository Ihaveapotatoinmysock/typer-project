this is janky af but a fun way to write, read and create files/folders for text documents 

you'll have to attach the the sound files to a, mp3 sound on your computer, make sure you have pygame installed 

to access folder write the folder name in terminal, need to spell correctly 

to read file prefix the file name with "read" 

to create new folder write "f" in terminal it will promt you to write a name 

to write a new teaxt file write "t" in the terminal it will promt you to write a name 

to write to a text file type "w" and then the file name, then whatever you write will be saved to a text file that you can read later
